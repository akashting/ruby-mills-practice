							<h1>Shri Manubhai Shah</h1>
							<p>Built on the solid foundation of technical expertise, impeccable product quality, and non-negotiable business ethics, the Ruby Mills have been the hallmark of textile innovation in India since 1917. This is the result of the leadership of our Chairman Emeritus Shri Manubhai Shah, who spent 66 years embedding these qualities in our DNA.
							</p><br>
							<p>
								Shri Manharlal Chunilal Shah was an exceptional human being and an outstanding leader. A towering personality in the Indian textile industry, he was also the chairman of the Bombay Mill Owners’ Association and the Bombay Textile Research Association. Shri Manubhai was a true visionary, a man far ahead of his times; he epitomised a dauntless entrepreneurial spirit.
							</p> <br>
							<p>
								Apart from his business interests, he was also deeply involved in numerous philanthropic acts. His sterling leadership qualities, remarkable foresight, uncompromising pursuit of excellence, humility, and phenomenal capacity to motivate and trust others set him apart. His values and ethics continue to inspire the way Ruby does business today.
							</p> <br>
							<p>As a pioneer in textile design, we believe in sharing knowledge to improve the quality of products across the industry. Our management has even been a part of the leadership of prestigious industry bodies such as the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry.
