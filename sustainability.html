					As India’s premier textiles mill, the responsibility towards leaving
					behind a sustainable environment is always put on a pedestal. We
					ensure that quality and sustainability go hand in hand. Right across
					the supply chain, each department is answerable on its sustainability
					initiatives. Even the smaller steps are recognised, and the right
					behaviour is incentivised.

							<h3>Sustainable Products</h3>
							<p>
								We have taken an active role in promoting sustainable fibres and
								are developing a variety of new fabrics by working closely with
								the fibre manufacturers. We look forward to collaborating with
								brands and designers who share our vision and concern for the
								planet and enable them to create sustainable products with our
								innovative fabric range.

							<h3>The Three-Pronged Approach</h3>
							<p>
								The precise environmental impact of textiles varies
								significantly depending upon the type of fibre, process,
								chemicals, water, energy and natural resources used. We have
								developed a three-pronged approach towards sustainability which
								encompasses Reduction, Recycling and Responsibility.

							<h3>Reduction</h3>
							<p>
								Reduction of wastages leads to optimum utilisation of available
								resources and improved efficiency across functions. We have been
								successful in instilling Reduction as a part of our day-to-day
								business approach.

							<h3>Recycling</h3>
							<p>
								Recycling is about inventing new ways of putting every resource
								to a productive and sustainable re-use. This reduces the amount
								of waste into landfills and incinerators and helps conserve the
								ever-depleting natural resources and also prevents pollution.

							<h3>Responsibility</h3>
							<p>
								Being an integral part of the community as well as the society
								for over a hundred years, we at Ruby take it as our prime
								responsibility to inculcate a taste for sustainable fabrics
								among consumers and through collaboration with fashion designers
								and brands.
